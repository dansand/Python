# Types

> ## Learning Objectives
>
> * Have a grasp on the basic Python data types
> * Understand the difference between type / class methods and function like `len()`
> * Introduce how types and methods are connected with Object Oriented programming

Python is dynamically typed: it means that you don’t declare a type (e.g. ‘integer’) for a variable name, and then assign something of that type (and only that type). Instead, you have variable names, and you bind them to entities whose type stays with the entity itself. a = 5 makes the variable name a to refer to the integer 5. Later, a = “hello” makes the variable name a to refer to a string containing “hello”
