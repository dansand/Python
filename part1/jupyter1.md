## Jupyter notebooks!

The Jupyter Notebook is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text.



Make sure you have a Notebook. If you're don't have iPython/Jupyter on your computer, you can run a temporary notebook here:
[Tempnb] (https://tmpnb.org/)

###Code

Not just Python! The Notebook has support for over 40 programming languages, including those popular in Data Science such as Python, R, Julia and Scala.

### Markdown

Explanatory text can be integrating with the Jupyter Notebook using a simple formatting schema called _Markdown_. See the link for a basic description.

### Literate programming 

Is an approach to programming introduced by Donald Knuth in which a program is given as an explanation of the program logic in a natural language, such as English, interspersed with snippets of macros and traditional source code, from which a compilable source code can be generated.
