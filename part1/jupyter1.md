## Jupyter notebooks!

The Jupyter Notebook is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text.

###Code

Not just Python! The Notebook has support for over 40 programming languages, including those popular in Data Science such as Python, R, Julia and Scala.

### Markdown

Explanatory text can be integrating with the Jupyter Notebook using a simple formatting schema called _Markdown_. See the link for a basic description.
