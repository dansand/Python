### What are they?

Notebook documents  are documents produced by the Jupyter Notebook App which contain both computer code (e.g. python) and rich text elements (paragraph, equations, figures, links, etc...). Notebook documents are both human-readable documents containing the analysis description and the results (figures, tables, etc..) as well as executable documents which can be run to perform data analysis.

The Jupyter Notebook App is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text.


### The notebook dashboard

The Notebook Dashboard is the component which is shown first when launching Jupyter Notebook App. The Notebook Dashboard is mainly used to open notebook documents, and to manage the running kernels (visualize and shutdown).



Make sure you have a Notebook. If you're don't have iPython/Jupyter on your computer, you can run a temporary notebook here:

###Code

Not just Python! The Notebook has support for over 40 programming languages, including those popular in Data Science such as Python, R, Julia and Scala.

### Markdown

Explanatory text can be integrating with the Jupyter Notebook using a simple formatting schema called _Markdown_. See the link for a basic description.

### Literate programming 

Is an approach to programming introduced by Donald Knuth in which a program is given as an explanation of the program logic in a natural language, such as English, interspersed with snippets of macros and traditional source code, from which a compilable source code can be generated.

### What about scripts?
